# :exclamation: New Version available
This repository is now archived, because I have reworked it entirely in a new repository: [Swords 'n Magic Interactive Map 2.0](https://github.com/Blechlawine/SwordsNMagic_InteractiveMap)

# Swords 'n Magic Interactive Map

An interactive map for planning your farming routes and finding stuff in the game Swords 'n Magic and stuff

## :exclamation: Announcement

The Heroku URL will stop working in November 2022, because Heroku is phasing out their free tier and I'm going to move the hosting to a different provider. This means your current private pins won't migrate over. But you can copy the data of your private pins out from localstorage in your browser and paste them into localstorage on the new URL when I launch the new hosting. Please search Google (or your search engine of choice) on how to do so.

PS: I'm still working on the next update, which is proving to be more work than I expected, because I'm updating the entire codebase to a new version of vue.
